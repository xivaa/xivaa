### Hi, I'm Alfonso Nava
#### I´m a 23 year old junior full stack devloper.
I am passionate about programming and it's ability to create solutions to everyday problems. Started my journey on Computer Science by taking Le Wagon's Web Development bootcamp, then I completed Harvard's CS50's certificate on CS where I learned laguages like C, Python and reinforced my skills in JavaScript. Currently I am getting another certificate on Python programming by CS50.

I wish I could join a team where I can develop my skills, both by being of great support, and by having experienced teammates whom I can learn from.
