## 🚀 Alfonso Nava — Full-Stack Developer | Mechatronics Mind | AI Explorer

Hey there — I'm Alfonso, a full-stack developer and mechatronics engineer-in-training who builds at the intersection of logic and magic ⚡️.

I write code with purpose — from clean, scalable frontends in **React/TypeScript** to powerful backend systems in **Node.js/Python**, and lately, I've been diving head-first into the beautiful chaos of **AI and LLMs**. I don’t just build software — I prototype the future.

- 🧠 Background in Mechatronics Engineering (GPA 9.12/10) — fusing physical systems with smart code.
- 🛠 2+ years of real-world dev experience: React, Python, AWS, React Native, Pandas, CI/CD.
- 🚀 Built MVPs, apps, automations, and API-driven tools — always shipping, always iterating.
- 🌍 Globally minded: adaptable, multilingual, and driven by curiosity.
- 🔮 Currently exploring: AI agents, LangChain, no-code workflows (n8n), prompt engineering.

Let’s connect. Let’s build. Let’s bend the rules of what’s possible.
